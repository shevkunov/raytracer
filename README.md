raytracer
=========

This is a C++ project for QT Creator 4.1.0 (uses QT Framework)

![demoscene](https://raw.github.com/shevkunov/raytracer/master/resources/rendered.png)

Mostly based on [this project](https://github.com/lagodiuk/raytracing-render), but almost all code from there was rewritten. 

Implemented: kd-tree with SAH, anti alialing using Sobel operator, refraction,
loading models from *.obj and something else...
